# This yaml file contains information about which user role can access which
# agents.
# This information will be the starter information that will be plugged into the DynamoDB table
# and will be used as a filtering criteria to invoke agents directly and have some determinism in place

  # For example, a user with the infrastructure specialist role will be
  # able to access the Infrastructure and the Default agent
  infrastructure_specialist: ['Infrastructure']
  # If the user represents the development tools role, then they
  # will have access to the default and the development tools agent
  development_tools_specialist: ['DevelopmentTools']
  # In this case the user with database administrator role will have access to database agent
  database_administrator: ['Database']
  # Service desk role with access to general IT support
  service_desk_agent: ['ServiceDesk']
  # This is the case when the user comes in with no context or matches the general IT support role,
  # all agents are enabled and the orchestrator agent decides which agent to call then

  # Network operations specialist
  network_operations: ['NetworkOps']
  # Security operations specialist
